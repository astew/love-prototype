Goals:
1. Turn over as much control of the game as possible to the LEVEL EDITOR. 
		The more varied the number of unique levels that can be generated 
		without touching code, the better off we are.

2. Keep the project designed such that it SCALES WELL.
		Ideally the amount of work required to add a new feature to the 
		game will be constant with respect to the total number of features 
		in the game (asymptotically, that is. In the mean time while we're
		still ironing the basics out, things will be worked and reworked
		until they're good.)

Things to do:

- Move gravity into the level.
- Add "use" functionality
- Make jump be based on whether you're on top of the ground.
- Move a lot of the functionality from Hero and Met to Actor.
- Make a generic "Enemy" class
